## "Design Thinking"

So hot right now.

How do you infuse design thinking into every day work?

* Process
* Education
  * Show value of design thinking in every day work
* Environment
  * How can the environment inspire people?

3 key areas in Design Thinking:

1. ideate
1. iterate
1. creative

### Ideate

Defined areas.

1. Breakout areas
  * Spread all throughout the office
1. Meeting rooms
  * Configurable / adaptable space
  * Example: tables can fold up
  * Every room has a set of tools:
    * Timer (cheap, inexpensive): Encourage time constraint
    * Stationary: when inspiration strikes, no fumbling around looking for a pen
    * A RUBBER CHICKEN! A way to keep people on track.
1. Design space
  * Modular spaces

#### Quick hacks:

* Start small
* Shuffle things around
* Drive certain work
* Facilitation items (the tools above)

### Iterate

Bring design out of the digital world into our physical environment. Encourage
feedback and iteration.

3 different types of walls

1. Exhibition
  * Every team has one
  * Must take the time & care to put their work up, and set the context
  * Anyone can come to the wall to understand the work
  * Asked to update it regularly so people come back
  * Invites feedback
    * Dot voting
    * Postits, etc
  * Can use the walls for customer testing too
1. All Purpose
  * Started with Whiteboards on wheels.
  * Tried big large whiteboard walls
  * But now, _everything_ is a whiteboard
  * Want to iterate on someting? Jump up to any nearby wall, then bring your
    peers over, and keep going
1. Transient wall
  * Portable
  * Foam core
  * Do work in meeting room, then bring it back out.

#### Quick hacks

* Start with key walls
* Set the context on the wall
* Ask for feedback
* Update it regularly

### Creativity

Not everyone is as comfortable with the ambiguity of design.

Use the space to inspire everyone

1. A _statement_ space
  * Corridors get an inspiration overhaul (quotes, etc)
1. Art
  * Encouraged to personalise space with artworks
  * Even if people aren't in day-to-day creative roles, encourage them to
    inspire their space and inspire others
1. Library
  * Space to go to and do focused work
  * And books, of course.

#### Quick Hacks

1. Let people express themselves
1. Find the essence of the company
  * Try and fuse that into the space

## Mistakes

1. Movable meeting room.
  * Really bad at being moved, and bad at being a meeting room.
1. Grey Boards
  * Cleaning them is hard
  * Dirty
1. Beautiful folding organ chairs that are recyclable.
  * But when you use them, they crumple

## Principles

* Iterative
* Adaptive
  * Make the space adaptable
* Suggestive
  * Give the space a vibe so it drives people to do certain types of work
* Inclusive
  * Design spaces that are welcoming to everyone
* Collaborative
  * Pull in people's opinions and ideas when designing the spaces

## Hack

Atlassians hackathon (ShipIt)

Started out focused on code only.

Evolved into hacking on other things (eg; physical space)

## Q&A

*Old stuff on the wall* - When do you take it down?

Give plenty of warning (like clearing the fridges)
