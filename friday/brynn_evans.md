# Beauty of ordinary design

Brynn Evans (Google Fi Project)

## Intro

Technology is changing faster than we can keep up.

Most of life is very ordinary (70%... of people will believe a made up
statistic). Breakfast, commute, ride bike, etc.

There are some bigger problems still considered "ordinary". Eg; Healthcare
(American?). Education, divorce, etc.

These areas deserve attention and a better experience for the people going
through it.

A lot of the work id not tackling these problems.

## Getting Old

We all get old. Right now. Did you feel it? You're older. Whoops, and again;
you're older still.

There is low-hanging fruit where we can meet the needs of the elderly. eg:
interacting with a touch panel on a wall is out of reach for them.

Dimensia is tragic & heartbreaking. We put them in a care home. That becomes
their life. Except "Demensia Village" in the Netherlands which is a real-life
Truman Show so the staff are disguised like residents of the village.
