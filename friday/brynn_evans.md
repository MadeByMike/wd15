# Beauty of ordinary design

Brynn Evans (Google Fi Project)

## Intro

Technology is changing faster than we can keep up.

Most of life is very ordinary (70%... of people will believe a made up
statistic). Breakfast, commute, ride bike, etc.

There are some bigger problems still considered "ordinary". Eg; Healthcare
(American?). Education, divorce, etc.

These areas deserve attention and a better experience for the people going
through it.

A lot of the work id not tackling these problems.

## Examples

We all get old. Right now. Did you feel it? You're older. Whoops, and again;
you're older still.

There is low-hanging fruit where we can meet the needs of the elderly. eg:
interacting with a touch panel on a wall is out of reach for them.

Dimensia is tragic & heartbreaking. We put them in a care home. That becomes
their life. Except "Demensia Village" in the Netherlands which is a real-life
Truman Show so the staff are disguised like residents of the village.

Veterans are another example where there are lots of sites, but they're all over the place, incomplete, cluttered, confusing, etc.

Immigration is another I've. Non English speakers often have to hire a lawyer just to navigate all the info.

my.uscis.gov is a good example of a modern, clean, easy to use site.

All the horrible forms are made much cleaner and simpler for people.

Not just that, but they're thinking end to end and taking it very seriously.

### Sex

Condoms are ubiquitous, but also stigmatized. Condoms are thousands of years old!

Since 1880's, there hadn't be much change.

Use went up, but in 1990's Africa stopped condom investment thinking "everyone knows to use then now". Then AIDS.

Bill & Melinda Gates foundation is funding new innovation in condoms.

### Communications

We all need them.

Works process are complicated, cost a lot, etc.

International travel is even harder.

Navigating all the options is even harder!

Enter: Project Fi at Google.

Spent months making sure all the little pieces are well thought out. Even the cancellation experience is nice.

As far as automatically connecting to open Wi-Fi and securing it for you.

No throttling. Auto stitches to the strongest signal (Wi-Fi vs LTE, etc), not just the closest.

## Tying it together

* Long standing issues
* Connect (sociality, politically, culturally)
* Experiences span period of time
* Service design (in fact, it's just product design)

## Take always

What can I do?

Revisit an old problem and ask; how can this be made better? E.g.: throw out assumptions and patterns.

Fix real pain points. Do a _lot_ of research.

Can we _remove_ something? E.g.: magic link to login Slack.

Expect users to change; track, research, adapt.

Integrate online and offline. Experiences don't just happen in your app. Things happen in real life too. Consider the context of the problem, the holistic experience.

Own the experience. Fill in the gaps in a flow, work around bureaucracy.
