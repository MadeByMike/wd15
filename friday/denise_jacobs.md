Wrote "The CSS Detective Guide", then had an apiphany:

> Creativity: powerful and empowering

"Am I creative?" "Is my work good?" Can get in the way.

Criticism-free creative sessions are one of the most enjoyable experiences
Denise has ever had.

Consults via "Creative Dose" company.

## The state of today

Modern work life is completely at odds with how our brains actually work.

* Demanding managers
* Bureaucracy
* Clients demanding things
* Time pressures
  * Focusing on "being productive" rather than allocating time to do it.

Results in:

* Mentally overwhelmened
* Mentally Oppressed

When we are in the creative flow state, it feels like [audience]:

* timeless
* euphoric
* a trance
* joyful
* powerful

## We are alchemists

We can take a nebulous concept and push it out into the world in some tangible
form.

> Creatiity is newness produced.

- Sir Ken Robinson

... It feels like magic

> Creativity is magical, bit it is not magic

- Dr Charles Limb

> Creativity is all about making connection and seeing patterns

- Bruce Nussbaum

## Our goals

* Emancipate (bad habits)
* Adjust (adjust our brains)
* Practice Discipline (so we can maintain those states)
* Generate & Execute (ideas)

### Emancipate

A mass hypnosis?

What's getting in our way?

* Meetings
* Email
* Timesheets
* Distractions

#### Habits and thinking to quit

*Distractions*

Distractions are not just the norm, but they're increasing.

Information overload, devices, emails, text messages, slack alerts, facebook
notifications, etc.

> Multitasking is multi-taxing

Multitasking is bad from a neuroscience perspective. Your brain can't focus on
multiple things at a time.

To switch between tasks, your brain completely shuts down, before getting to the
next task. So, there is a lag time when switching between tasks.

_Zeigarnik Effect_: When you start a tasks, your brain will start processing it.
If it gets distracted, it keeps processing it subconsciously, and so on for
every tasks.

*Communication addiction*

It's actually a real thing.

Based on Intermittent reinforcement (the rat & the level experiment - aka: The
person and the email refresh button)

It's a shot of dopamine each time.

Internalized the critical voices. It all adds up, and they become monsters in
our heads (we beat ourselves up because we're not getting anything done, etc).

Instead of Creativity, we start practicing _Destructivity_, all due to your
Inner Critic.

Your Inner Critic is not only physchological, it's neurological. Your therapist
isn't going to be able to help you "work it out".

_Everyone_ has these thoughts.

> If your demons are such tha tthey fill the room the instant you contrplate
> crating, your studio will be too dangerous a place to enter

- Eric Maisel

These are your Inner Critic:

* "I should have done more by now..."
* "They'll find out I'm a fraud" - Imposter syndrome
* Dunning Kruger effect - people discount skills of others thinking theirs are
  higher
* "It must be flawless!" - Perfectionism
* "I'll do it tomorrow..." - Procrastination

These are all fears.

| | Fear
| --- | ---
| F | False
| E | Evidence
| A | Appearing
| R | Real

Or... "Fuck Everything And Run".

> Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.

### Adjust

> The parts o your brain that are responsible fself-monitoring are literally
> turned off during creative endeavors... Creative people have mastered the art of
> turning off [the inhibitive] par tof their brains to let their ideas flow more
> smoothly, unleasing their imagination.

1. Say no to comparisons
  * You can not compare your insides to someone eleses outsides!
  * Compare yourself to yourself
  * "I will not compare myself to strangers on the internet"
2. Imposter syndrome paradox
  * You will only experience impostor syndrome when you are competent and
    skilled.
3. Break the lop beteween perfectionism & procrastination
  * Decouple your sense of identiy from performance (perfectionism)
  * Increase the meaning of something / make quotas for yourself
  * (procrastination)
4. Reassign your inner critic to have duty elsewhere
  * When you're editing / debugging / etc, inner critic can be helpful
5. Amp up the empathy
  * Inner critic means well... Say "thanks", but I don't need you right now
6. Maintain perspective
  * Say to yourself: "So what?"
  * "Just because you're thinking something doesn't mean it's true"
7. Reframe Failure & mistakes
  * "Failure is only th eopportunity to begin again more intelligently." - Henry
    Ford
  * The more often you fail / make mistakes, the faster you progress
8. Change your body language, change your mind
  * "Our bodies change our minds, our minds change our behaviour, and our
    behaviour hcanges our outcomes"
  * Audience participation: Strike a super man pose for at least 15seconds

*Train your brain*

Left Brain v Right Brain? No, not really.

Right brain has more connections

The left side has far fewwer connections within itself, and beyond the rest of
the bbrain. The left hemisphere is made of neatly stacked verical columns
(pancakes?).

Ie; Left brain puts together the information.

So you need both halfs to be creative.

The hard part: Accessing the things.

Enter: Brain waves.

From higher frequence to lower frequency wave:

* Gamma
  * The a-hah state! When everything clicks.
* Beta - alert, conscious, concentrating
  * If you're in beta too long, it's where anxiety exists
* Alpha
  * Alert & lucid, more internally focused (relaxed thoughts, creative is amped
    up. Children spend most of their time in this state)
* Theta
  * Super high states of creativity. REM sleep, experienced meditator
* Delta
  * Unconscious - bigger than yourself state. Transidental meditation. Ever
    woken up feeling like a brand new person - probably due to Delta during
    sleep

Alpha is the gateway to creativity.

By relaxing (close your eyes, deep breaths, eyes up and to the side), you're
moving your brain from Beta to Alpha.

Hacks to get there:

1. Breathe - a few deep breaths
1. Be prone / lay done
1. Showers
1. Space out / daydream.
1. Get physical. Cross Channel Movement (eg swinging arms while walking) - helps
  your brain hemispheres sync with eachother

> When your brain is supposedly doing nothing, it's really doing a tremendous
> amount.

- Marcus raichle

### Practice Discipline

Focus on meaningful tasks.

Show up every day - even if it's only for a few minutes, it's worth it.
(actually commit to it)

Delegate things you dont want to do. It fees you up to possibly come up with the
solution yourself.

Clean-up habit fields. Have a "distraction" chair where you go every time you
want to be distracted.

Manage time. Single task. Say "NO" to distractions. Tools:
[RescueTime](http://rescuetime.com) / [HeyFocus](http://heyfocus.com) / Strict
Workflow / StayFocusd

Pomodoro Technique: 30 min; 25min sprint + 5min rest.

### Generate & Execute

We want to start the flow of ideas.

Start with what's there. You don't have to always come up with new things.

> Good artists imitate. Great artists steal.

Everything is a remix.

*Create constraints deliberately*: Then work within the box.

Capture your ideas. Embrace disruption / write them down. Sketch, talk, record,
etc.

Then gather and curate your ideas.

Prototype stuff. Iterate, review, reisterate.

This all sets the stage for *flow*.

Flow is when you have a high level of challenge / complexity and a high skill
level.

It gives you an "Afterglow" where you can continue being creative, and it's
easier to get back there.

Do all this, and you will regain creative confidence.
