# Souls & Machines: Designing the future of content

Hannah Donovan

Excellently personality filled outfit - perfect way to kick off the second day
:)

_Ed note: My notes are a little incoherent at times - I got caught up in the
excellent presentation! Sorry!_

## The topic

2 cities, 3 jobs, all because Hannah's been chasing chasing the intersection of
_product_ and _content_.

Why? Because Hannah is really passionate about it (and it's worth chasing your
passions).

Tech companies are good at digital products, but fall down when they try to tell
the story associated it.

Old school media companies are great at telling stories, but their tech isn't
quite there.

BuzzFeed manages to hit the intersection nicely.

Design, dev, product, everyone touches content at some point

## Who likes fun?

Confession time:

> I design for desires not needs.

Hannah is not solving problems that _need_ to be solved. And that's ok.

We are spoiled for choice. The sooner you figure out what you like working more
on, the happier you're going to be.

Worked in Music & Entertainment: last.fm -> Jam -> MTV -> Drip

Focuses:

* Music & Entertainment
* Recommendations
* Self expression
* Social Connections

## Story Time

It's cold, wet, London, so use [lovefilm.com](http://lovefilm.com) to get DVDs
in the mail. The one that arrived; Blade Runner!

Lessons learned from Blade Runner:

> * Content without context is confusing.
> * Content without connection isn't relevant
> * Content without perspective has no feeling.

Publishers, books, magazines, record labels are actually good at these three
things

Book: "Content Strategy For the web" Kristina Halvorson

Authors know their content.
Publishers know their audience. They make the content make sense for the people
who are going to consume it.

*Disclaimer*: _Content_ doesn't just mean "editorial". The lines are blurred
Between user generated content, editorial, internal etc.

## Content

### Access

Napster, etc - how do we get access to content?

### Discovery

2008 something changed: iTunes Connect, Spotify, Jam.

How do people find things to listen to, rather than already knowing what they
want?

| Desire | Void
| --- | ---
| I want this thing now | I want something...?
| Search | Browse
| On Demand | Recommendation

#### Desire

When I know exactly what I want, I already have:

* context
* connection
* perspective

#### Void

When I don't know what I want, what I _need_ is:

* context
* connection
* perspective

... That's hard.

> Knowing what we want is hard.

Solving for the problem of Void is hard!

2012/2013/2014 SXSW Man Vs Algorithm "Face-off" (how to recommend things, etc) -
are we _still_ arguing about this?

> Humans connect us in ways computers can't
> 
> Computers connect us in ways human's can't.

* Humans
  * Emotions, ideas, etc
* Computers
  * Scale
  * Democratised descitions, etc

The future of content is understanding both of these things

## Context

> We are the connective tissue between the content and the experience.

We === Designers, content managers, etc.

Eg;
* A Badly curated art show is not good.
* A great film in a bad cinema.

> What is the wrapper around the content so the user has a great experience with
> it?

Think about it up front.

### Music

Is extremely messy. (eg; spotify, mixtapes, etc, etc).

Jam tried to give visual context around songs. (Previously was like a
spreadsheet)

If you don't have the context, it's on you as the product designer to figure it
out.

> On it's own, [content] is pretty dumb, until some smart design system grabs it
> and displays it in the right context

- Mark Boulton

Eg: NYT app shows "Good Morning. [weather] Here's what you need to know to start
your day".

## Connection

Can be really personal.

Last.fm - User research surfaced that no one like their recommendations.

Why? Recommendations weren't bad. People just don't want to listen to new music
all the time - it's too much. Airwaves radio has this sorted otu really well -
mostly plays music you know, with the occasional new song shoved in.

Last.fm made "My Mix" full of recent stuff you know / love, with a few new
things mixed in. Much better engagement.

Last.fm tried really hard to algorithmically recommend music, but the best music
recommendations come from friends. 

Jam hit on a good playlist by only asking folks for thier _favourite_ songs.

Timehop is a good example of strong connection (of time).

## Perspective

(Hannah's fav)

The most important thing you can have as a designer. The worst kind of designs
are the ones that _don't_ elicit a strong response.

Hannah loves it when people scream they hate it, or email saying they love it,
but hates it when it's only crickets.

> Computers can't give a damn.

Humans can wrap the content with a story.

Emotional connections.

## Blade Runner

Context Content, and Perspective are the things that Culture is made of

Design is about cultural invention.

Music is tribal. Folks want to be in a fan-club because they get to feel a part
of something.

Meanwhile the average spend on music is hugely declining (-71% since 1999)

> We're designing for a "post-content" world

We've gone full circle. Before recording, music had all the emotional
connections, perspective, context around the content, and it was really
successful.
