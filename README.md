## Kap Watkins

VP of design at BuzzFeed

Wanted to be a designer. Went through the start up grinder ([PMOG](http://www.pmog.com), Zoosk, Farm Spring). Ended up at Amazon.

Found out what he didn't know by working in a design team for the first time. Got a mentor / friend he still talks to today.

Manager at Etsy. Team learning.

BuzzFeed. Built essentially Tamagotchi on your watch (Hambone). Tech team is 170ish people out of 1300 employees (inc 15 designers).

How do you create a culture that values design?

It's hard. You _will_ experience failure, and the wind won't be as big as you really want.

The only way to start making this better: define your ideal state of the world. Really think about it, asks write it down.

But, not "Design makes all the decisions". You're never as benevolent or nice as you'd like.

Don't silo design, product, engineering. Try overlap them where possible.

The Design-then-hand-off-then-give-back-then-red-line-then-hand-off-again cycle is really bad.

Don't be afraid to pretend you're already doing what you want to do. If you hire someone, tell them you're already doing it, and they will because to them "that's how you do it". That's the momentum you need to change.

Initial discussions involve all product, designers, engineering (via basecamp). It's the moment to crystallize what the team thinks. Don't do design right at the start. Talk it out, and collaborate.

Designers should code. They weren't in BuzzFeed, but taught themselves and wrote a whole style guide (Solid).

Use treehouse for cooperative learning sessions in the team.

Bugs filled as `design-tweaks` never get fixed (prio too low). So, instead, set aside time with 1 designer, and 1 engineer at least once a week to spend an hour fixing things and shipping to production. Bonus: Exposes the designer to the production code base too!

None of this is easy. Chance is hard, and often creates uncertainty about the future. Acknowledge and empathise to get through it. Make them your partner. E.g.: tell the designers they're the experts, and they need to help the developers (and vice versa).

Role documentation (how to progress, etc) is needed. Kap did it for design, but didn't stoop there: did it with engineering, etc, too (in collaboration with the leads there), and that built a lot of trust.

Don't be afraid to let things go. Especially the small things. Then when you *do* fight for something, people believe you're serious.

Really think about how much you care about it. Is it important? Can you let it go?

Be patient. Have the grand vision, but work your way towards it. Especially for organisational changes.

Feeling like you can't do anything about it? Start small, start local. Make your little team the best Fucking team out there. Someone will eventually take notice, and another team will get on board, etc. At worst, you'll enjoy coming to work every day.
