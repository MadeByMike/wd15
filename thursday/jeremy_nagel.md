[Examples from safety culture](http://bit.do/checklists)

Humans are fallable.

Even NASA make mistakes. Mark orbiter rover crashed:
* 1 newton second != 1 pound * 1 second

Therac radiation machine.

*We (coders) are responsible*

We're working 70hr weeks, we've got confirmation bias, how do we stop it.

Enter: Checklist Driven Development

Taken to the extreme: Pilots now have up to 300 checklists to cover every single
scenario. Doctors / Medical staff do the same for surgery, etc.

Try add the checklist to your JIRA so it shows up with moving tickets between
swimlanes.

## Doing CDD

1. Expect pushback
1. Beware checklist fatigue
1. Raise the bar
1. Enhance Collaboration

### Expect pushback

> It somehow feels beneth us to use a checklist, and embarrassment. It runs
> counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly great among us - those we
> aspire to be - handle situations of high stakes and complexity

- The checklist maifesto

Explain things, make it clear the goals.

Don't expect full adoption over night. Lumosity only has about 35% of checklist
usage.

### Beware Checklist Fatige

If you have a long checklist. People will get annoyed. Keep it concise.

Automate some of the steps if you can. (eg; CI unit tests on branches, etc)

### Raise the bar

Use them to enshrine best practices. Encourage people to work better than they
otherwise were.

Eg;
* Have you considered usability?
* Have you increased test coverage?

### Enhance Collaboration

Doesn't it run counter to Agile? It adds another process.

But, it could be used to enhance collaboration, for greater benefit to everyone.
